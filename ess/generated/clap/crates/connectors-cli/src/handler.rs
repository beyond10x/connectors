//! What is owed: one method per command the tree places.
//!
//! A method receives `clap::ArgMatches` rather than the command's declared input type. The
//! Rust target already emits every input as a type, and a fourth rendering of the type layer
//! would be a fourth thing to keep in step — so this target emits the grammar and leaves the
//! types where they are. `TARGET.md` states that as a weakening rather than leaving it to be
//! discovered.
